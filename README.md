It helps teams efficiently estimate the effort required for tasks using intuitive poker card voting, fostering collaboration and consensus in a fun and engaging way. Ideal for remote and in-office teams, Scrum Poker enhances accuracy and transparency in project planning.

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, install the necessary dependencies:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
